#This is the Project of Web Designing Workshop 
1. Download the code in zip format & extract it
2. Open the Folder in IDE like VS Code
3. For Easy :
   -> Create your own logo in square and name it `logo.png`
   -> Ensure that transparent or White background for better sake.
   -> replace it with exisiting `logo.png` in `images` folder.
   -> Do this for every image if you want
4. Do not Change the file's location unless you know the cause, if do
   then changes it's path where it needed.
   
5. Open the `index.html` with `live-server` by right clicking on the `index.html`

-> Enjoy The Prototype !
